# WeatherDashboard

## Description
As a full stack web developer, I want to build a weather dashboard for travelers to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they can plan a trip accordingly.


# Usage
To use this weather dashboard application with form inputs, first, search for a city.  You will be presented with current and future conditions for that city.  That city will then be added to the search history.  When you view the current weather conditions for that city, you will be presented with the city name, date, and an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed.  When you view future weather conditions for that city, you will be presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.  Click on a city in the search history to be presented with current and future conditions for that city.
